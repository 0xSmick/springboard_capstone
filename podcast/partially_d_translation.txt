you're listening to partially derivative season two episode eight 
nndb nndb buccaneer paper podcast about data general degree from the founders of properly the first platform for totally automated super amazing customer facing absolutely badass analytics 
I'm Jonathan I'm dissipates and the software engineer 
I'm Nydia and I also works for probably 
I'm Chris and %HESITATION I'm still here I guess 
so I don't think 
well 
just one week at that didn 
you made it this far yeah totally where we're glad that you're still with us 
%HESITATION as always we're gonna stay at the shop but some drinking which is definitely but it sounds like Chris needs right now %HESITATION so if you're thirty everybody %HESITATION video but he'd taken 
while I'm super excited %HESITATION I'm drinking sessions this is the cream premium summer ale %HESITATION a comes in and I think of of 
%HESITATION a whole bunch of other sessions it's pretty awesome at the golden ale with the creamy head and a smooth sweet personality has a lot of federal technology eyes actually without a little 
yeah but you know I think half the day unknot half like ninety present time I'm buying beer because of the word 
I'm totally just basing it off of their marketing but it's delicious 
and it's kind of a summary like lovely little treat to celebrate this rare week of sunshine and warmth in Portland %HESITATION and makes me wish I had like a porch and fireflies and like one of those rocking chairs and some friends to sit around listen supplying the wealthier nd also you know so maybe 
who all the money Portland stopping such a jerk going up 
yeah I know on her porch the doesn't exist 
or higher funds that are all probably gone off 
well I mean the other hand and drinking a wonderful class 
Cuba and lime nnhs a glass why don't fulfill applicant is less like a it's like it's even edn I %HESITATION I like some of the important ingredients that one would need for like a good Margarita plus it's just it's just tequila lime juice for me right now 
the very bold strongly low calorie the lazy man's Marguerite yeah I love it exactly 
most of the 
radiance but you know I think I was just going to Cuba nd I don't think that has a special name nnj 
I'm pretty good dnmt 
sn checks go boxes mn 
that's awesome so it'll be the best show ever %HESITATION I am thinking something a little bit less harsh %HESITATION a Belgian cold ale from the south Austin brewing company and its lights mood and tasty 
%HESITATION is very good it's actually getting hot in Texas and some repairs are definitely on everybody's mind 
%HESITATION so come down to Texas where it's nice and warm you can enjoy this beautiful Pierre I don't know that if you saw but it turns out friends here are about half of what they are even in Oakland give it up mn Josh 
okay alright I nto %HESITATION before we go any further de of course have to give a shout out to our sponsor everybody do a little buggy do the name a who has never sponsor five actors %HESITATION he %HESITATION their platform for distributing micro task to humans it's an amazing resource when you're working on data projects Anthony look human touch base with any kind of scale come there three different product offerings 
they lean production for ongoing high volume data work is an API to interact with their platforms he can make it do exactly what you need I'm agile production when you have 
but basically I can be a team of data squad to work with your tools are on your platform %HESITATION and batch production so when you have kind of a one time a semi regular project that you just need to get off the plate that's perfect for that %HESITATION they've brand new website where they're making it super easy to see which products meet your needs if up pricing calculators that show you an estimated price for your project 
or for ongoing works and and 
is the kicker as I'm sure everybody has heard me say before but I just wanna remind you this may be your last chance 
because for a limited time cloud factories offering a ten percent discount on either your first month for on your project and it's a one time project this is exclusively for listeners a partially derivative because here's here's what they said to me we were behind closed doors and they were like I've heard a lot of high test nnat cast aesthetic and so we're gonna get the ten percent only to your listeners and I was like wow that's a little harsher words are star 
there was a strong and I guess I take it I think a compliment and soon and with that you know I pull the sword out of the stone and now now dnmt 
well now we give you ten percent how that ten percent ten percent you've all been knighted access data says vague attempts an uppercut factory %HESITATION just in case %HESITATION cut back I never said any of those things 
maybe so but he did that that just automatically 
that ten percent is totally real numbers that is illegal actually seriously think about is a it is a it is a fantastic service %HESITATION for like a lot of the really like annoying parts of data work the knowing tedious parts data work should athletes because your data scientists and you get paid way too much to demand 
I'm so glad that we got com slash partially to learn how to claim your discounts and %HESITATION and sign up for the product super awesome 
okay and with that I think we're ready are we ready 
we are limited already 
I'm totally lame so promising us right now offense nnj 
I am doing my personal meaning 
I kn 
okay 
so 
picture this 
there you are 
wasting time 
scrolling through Facebook 
watching other people's lives get better and better than your soul cool they've amazing vacation photos yet as you do all their babies are adorable press nnhs picky about maybe 
I know I know 
%HESITATION it was their job announcements 
and you're like a dog 
and then whatever right so then you oppose that really stings that post that beyond all these other things is a real punch in the gut 
and that my friends 
is the spoiler on her us I know dated 
people who post less people are the worst there is like do I want to be friends with you wires even on my feet right now exactly their big douchebags we can just come out and said we can say we can expect a missile 
yeah we said everything else thirties 
I mean they ruin Netflix binge watching for the rest of us 
or every major movie released or at major sporting events or whatever 
like what's the point of life after that like why like I know I want to know what was happening on how the guards amount nto I know 
because just because you like friend from sixth grade 
it's hash tag class 
capability 
beautiful goddam family 
have time to watch TV all the time for every show in its entirety that we can that it gets posted a Netflix it doesn't mean the rest of us when it now what happens in advance 
just because I know there's a date assigned subplot and house cut the line I want no coca one 
don't say it 
I'm just guessing did fair this is not really a spoiler it's really not all that doesn't give it away 
it is for me and I don't know whether there's a part of it's not online I just wanted you to feel bad alright I thought guilty for just a second there is actually I don't know we said I'd love to hear back from this I don't know why we haven't talked about this yet on the show there is a data signed up because we don't give away spoilers the fact that there is one is Hardenberg distance from the season from house of cards we can all talk about it because I would really like to hear people's opinion there's one scene that has some underwear and and some dancing and I would really like to hear what everybody thinks about 
but the question is the question I'm going to ask if this is the point of the story what if things didn't have to be like this 
like what if you hadn't seen Star Wars and you didn't want to know in advance that a certain someone was a certain other someone sister they really shouldn't be kissing 
or or maybe a certain someone in a scary mask who might be able to choke people with his mind was actually another someone's father got another someone thought it would be super happy at all they be like dnmt 
way it's a when you you just because you say the words someone that doesn't mean you're not giving it a ha ha ha ha ha ha 
maybe job with a high 
but he had no 
against her 
totally everybody that 
the cat the game now is to try and guess who in the new movie is the love child of Java the Hutt and princess Leia Husn 
wouldn't that be a spoiler okay 
the point is getting rid of the spoilers this is a job 
for data science 
now it all comes back 
yeah so 
Ruth toner 
who's on the community team at twitch 
but the tool called vanguard 
and vanguard basically reads tumblr 
checks for spoilers and then prevents you from seeing them 
Mike dropped wow lividity asa I know 
exactly how does it prevent you from seeing them well does it have people walking around like 
stopping you've described before total it's a tool that deploys real human beings to your home or office if not artificial Intel 
against 
it's beyond artificial intelligence beyond its actual intelligence 
it's in this predicament paladins because the they only use precogs so some momentum nnat of minority report and they put them in your place nnhs run about and they like freak out when you're about to see a study second edn around his little but before you visit a web page like three wooden balls roll down dnmt 
yes this is what this tour vanguard does exactly all of this absolutely because you might think if you're not using precogs for minority report and your name isn't Tom Cruise how could such magic be possible 
most people 
mentioned Star Wars in the body of the post it turns out 
and they might even use a spoilers hashtag because they're not hashtag unless your bags 
from six grade they're good citizens of the internet who just want to talk about how shocked they were when Kyla ren killed 
say well I'm just gonna clothes that would be a sport I love that would I know is I tiptoed right up to the ads 
if you call them douchebags eat you are tempted yourself I know I know this is you know me you know me for long enough I like to be right on a knife edge something abuse back or not 
wait real quickly so you know the people that were that use the spoilers hash tag okay unknown to the world can you please use that hashtag before we put it out again and hashtag this is really very authentic blessed 
vannatter like dammit mn 
you just put it right in the title dnmt 
it's like your linkedin post that uses the new Star Wars is a metaphor for you know efficient meeting dnmt 
yes but hashtag hashtag spoilers right at the top 
%HESITATION that because you're right paid people don't actually follow those rules sometimes people even put this weather has taken their post at all so you're just like I know 
creek 
because now now you have to identify a post that isn't just about Star Wars but also might give something away about the plot with no context 
and that's what Ruth did though with vanguard 
back to Ruth and family she used nmsiis of natural language processing and machine learning techniques to create features that basically accurately identify a Star Wars spoiler posts 
so 
she if you're at a date a person you know that you can take a big bunch of tax and you can create some features from it that's what's called quote unquote features 
and so she created some features like the most common words the top tags and then she use those features to train a machine learning model and presto 
now 
now you too can benefit from his hard work she had actually %HESITATION eyes you can dress up Baca's explaining how she did it how she built vanguard that you can get to and I think there's a Google chrome extensions you can go get the after yourself at vanguard dot X. Y. Z. and this is basically a long form shout out to Ruth thank you for your service 
the community 
and to humanity 
I heard her 
you know what I really like about this is that in order for her to actually build vanguard she really needed to train up you know model using machine learning to detect the 
kind of posts 
but that means that someone either her or some unlucky grad student perhaps 
had to go through all of these posts unspoilt everything for themselves 
because we like up yep that's a spoiler up that's not a spoiler chancellor it's like it's the hidden costs of doing data collection 
I'm sitting there ruining TV 
for yourself 
for the next year are 
you know what would I get Binhai goodies case for that 
cloud factory you can just ruin it for all I care dnmt 
sn within you know they're getting paid for it so that the country is like a sacrifice though I don't think it's ruining it it's like you know it's noble so noble cause 
no because maybe a prompt people to watch the movie in advance thought I don't watch the new Star Wars so that I'm not affected by the spoilers 
I don't know about me and maybe the movies will give like pre screenings to people who are going to prevent spoiling that what you're facing the Hobey also 
that between I want to sign up like I'll be part of the Army Reserve of spoiler dnmt with with incredible the %HESITATION with with with apologies to everybody who's in the actual Army Reserve nnj 
no 
I had to I 
to marginalize the important work that you're doing I'm the I think though then they could be great though because then you'll be the first person in your in your apartment complex to the first 
to know that Kyla renders the love child job oughtn't but then all I did is I might attract 
it might attract all the douche bags to do that and then they get a car I don't know because they get some kind of sick joy I don't think you know everything like I'm in the going to hate the Facebook Ahmanson theater and 
it's like all the kids that were on for ten ten years ago they grew up and had babies and other this role rule ruined sport like Star Wars with our friends on Facebook 
because they got all 
sn dnmt 
fallout okay %HESITATION alright so 
Iraq that right up 
I'm before going to the next or we're going to try something a little different this week and we know that a lot of you are programmers actually but as I'm sure Chris can attest %HESITATION sometimes data science PhDs cough armed they need a little help 
it's making the transition from writing scripts are you know a model that mundus someday together whatever or anything that basically needs 
acute once or twice sufficient for two more complete applications you might say bullet %HESITATION that's what my mentor my picture who are we talking about we talking about sunline not you someone who's had a certain someone who might 
a little problem %HESITATION 
that someone again if it is I know I know 
I am so if you too are a character in Star Wars whose fate is being ruined by the internet %HESITATION etcetera if your programmer who I would like to get a little bit more experienced I'm writing software applications that are a little bit you know more battle hardened for the real world I'm we're thinking about having experienced programmers come on the show and equipped like five minute programming tips 
so if you let us know if you're into this idea on Twitter at partially day or by email hello at partially derivative dot com so we know whether you want us to do more of it 
%HESITATION and with that in mind here's Michael Kennedy the host of the amazing and very popular talk python to me podcast and the author of talk python training a fantastic new series of video courses for learning python yours Michael 
eight out of ten and everyone out there it's great to be here yeah so this I hear you got some awesome cool I'm programming advice for us 
I absolutely do we've been tossing out ideas on 
what kind of programming 
techniques and tips would be really good for data scientists and I think I have a really great one for you it's about this concept of generators Cortines an iterators and it's it's really good about sort of taking large data and processing it in a very efficient way abilities data processing pipelines 
and we'll talk about that today 
yeah what's really interesting about these %HESITATION generator methods in these coke routines as they have been around for quite awhile 
didn't python since two thousand one dot at sea sharp out of them in two thousand five ecma script six that that's the new job script that's coming out this year is just adding basically copying the python style into the new version of Java script so there's a lot of languages that that use this technique 
and the ideas you can create a method 
and the method looks just like any other method takes arguments it returns values returns a collection that's really really important part return some kind of a sequence or a collection 
and you write your code it typically what you might do with these types of methods 
is it would create like a list or some kind of collection and you would do all the processing like yours but say you're trying to search or filter bunch of text for some kind of 
value or or match or something right you go into that you're gonna go to the entire text file unity all the processing and each time you find a match or put into the list when you're totally done then you return from that method here's a list return list right that standard program right but it's the whole thing right now is how to shut the whole thing you collect the entire list everything that might possibly want and then you return it to whatever called the French 
right you have a basic right Ireland acid thing just sitting there kind of in the machine's memory 
yeah totally invited you all the computation tip before you even get the sort of knowledge of whether there's something in a sequence or not 
but what if you want to go through some data set you know Michael I could just go with the first five that I think is really I you know whatever reason I'm looking for like houses that are nearby phones search all the houses that are nearby and try to buy a house maybe I'm willing to show five on a page anyway so let's stop there right through these generators let you take a different approach 
and they're sort of this combination the concept of a generator and a co routine 
and the first time people see this it's like mind blowing 
and I think I do a lot of training and almost everyone I talk to 
this doesn't really make words use of this concept and ideas this 
instead of seeing criminalist and filled up with data and then return to list all at once all computed you can use these key words and the different 
and apart on the keyword is yield and sometimes you'll see a variation knuckle deals from 
so 
what you do is you basically write the method as if you had the list 
if you just delete the last and anytime you would 
add an item to the list you instead say yield that item 
and though runtime basically reinterprets this method to say okay it looks like you're sort of given up one item in returning sing yield but in fact it's 
it's reinterpreting what you're writing and say okay what that means is we're gonna turn a sequence like a list that you can iterate on 
and every time you say you'll do say here's an item in the list 
now that sounds like the same type of thing with less typing but what happens is that's where this concept of a couple routine comes at 
and so the way it works is you go through the execute method to get that first yields and then it immediately stopped turning them at that returns to the original color like you do know leaping from process that print out saved our database whatever 
and then you loop again 
it goes back into sort of resumes right where the less it left off comes back in does little more competition for the next element gives it back your cookies on it so it's kinda like this 
out back and forth 
running between the thing that's consuming the sequence in the things generating a sequence 
and you can actually change these things together right I've got one thing that binds all the houses and I got another sort of generator that 
soldiers the houses down farther and and you can sort of treat these data pipelines in a superficial way okay so that sounds cool like I'm I I get that okay you're going back and forth between the caller and the function that's iterating over my sequencer whatever 
but but why why would I do it that way why are these Cortines better than just putting everything in a less than dealing with the whole list after habit 
because it is like a certain sex is always wrong yeah 
it does exactly it's more complicated from a conceptual perspective the code is actually cleaner but after you look at it like what the heck is going on here 
so there's a couple of benefits and it really 
really shines when basically two situations one computing any individual element of that sequence is computationally expensive 
right 
and 
the other one is if it sort of memory intensive to compute all of them 
so for example like let's suppose you're doing some scientific calculation you wanna start pulling those items out you're not totally sure when you're going to stop 
right you as the person concealing the series right %HESITATION if maybe the deviation between the previous element and the next element is twenty I'd like to stop 
processing is items but as the person implements the method that generates a sequence you know about that is like here's all the numbers or results that you're asking for 
this allows the caller to sort of slowly consume them without paying any extra overhead so in my class that I just finished an online class forum private developers called python jump start by building ten apps I this example and it does are sort of 
we got a text search recursively across directories 
and it's originally written in the list style that we talked about and to run it it takes like four hundred megs 
maybe fifteen seconds to process to search 
two point two gigs of text 
was that our hundred megs of member critics like it's actually consuming four hundred megabytes of the computer's resources 
basically like real time reserve that's right yeah 
absolutely real time resources because it goes to the whole directory tree of 
continue to get the files can it grabs all elements in its stores analysts and when it finally gets all to gigs process go to very carefully here's the list and it has a hold all that for Emory right 
and 
we can change this like a change is the zeal return artists are just your keyword in and return 
the the individual elements in basically 
you don't change the code at all other than replacing a list out of hand with the yield and just delete the less right it operates the same way but instead of using four hundred Meg to do all this processing of memory that uses one Meg 
well %HESITATION that's amazing I mean that's like the difference between actually being able to run something on your laptop in a larger example and not right but that's a that's a huge effort as you're absolutely 
it's it's tremendous yeah and the thing is that's 
just go into the whole sequence entirely what if we wanted to find just the first ten matches but we didn't know where they were right we could just in our sort of consumption Benko Oduya ten just stop when you stop pulling on these iterators these generator methods they stop computing and they're just died 
so instead of taking fifteen seconds to do all the processing it might take 
hundred milliseconds 
but exactly the same code 
and the consumer that uses your library gets to decide when they stopped not the producer 
well that's pretty fantastic I mean that that that really is like armed 
I mean I may be 
on a one off example you might say like 
if you're not sort of stretching the extent of the of the computer's memory even like what whatever like it's just a script I'm gonna run one time no big deal but I think this is a really important distinction between just writing a script once so it finishes and it's kind of been happy with that and actually writing an application something that has to run 
you know maybe a variety of environments are and it's kind of a variety of circumstances many circumstances that we can't predict in advance and so making your code a little bit more resilient against well you know weird things that people do in the real world you know unexpected security absolutely finder application and 
and it seems like it's a it's a really sort of straightforward way too out what stock echoed from being abused if that makes sense 
yeah I don't really make sense and I think the thing to take home is it's actually less code to write it simpler right it's slightly harder to understand but once you get the Zen of it it's like okay this is no problem did a thing as it lets you build composable elements 
so 
each one of these little generators can take some input take a sequence and then do more processing return some kind of transformed or filtered or otherwise modified set of elements so that way you can create sort of chains of processing that do all kinds of different things you could wreak reuse them develop these pipelines I think that super relevant to their scientists 
yeah absolutely I think I mean pretty much all of us every time we've done any kind of work on a data set and had this step through a series of transformations to make the data more usable or to maybe derive a feature that wasn't in the original data but we were 
calculating 
and I think having the 
functions that were writing to do those transformations in a way that we can just grab and plug into new pipeline whenever we have today the process kind of piecemeal and one by one her you know like putting a puzzle together I think that you can save a ton of time 
so that's fantastic but that really is that it's it's feels cool like writing real applications now not just you know that not just little scripts 
yeah I entirely agree with that and actually put together our document you can share it's got some code examples and in there it has sort of the traditional the style called in block method calls where generates a feminazi sequence 
and it returns you to specify limit because if you just give me all the numbers and things infinite sequence it would run out of memory trying to add it to the listener would never finish 
flip that to the generator style with the yield keyword and it's 
trivial it's like our five or six lines of code to write the infinite feminazi sequence in the most efficient way possible 
it's awesome that super close and check out Jazmin so where can people learn more about these awesome programming tips because your this is this is kind of it was a big thing that you're doing I mean probably people are familiar with your podcast talk by things to me but you're also kind of verging into this type of instruction for the world at large American 
yeah absolutely so last month I just launched a an online course a video course called python jump start by building ten apps and one of the ops we build really two of them actually they build on each other are all about this type of processing so check that out it training dot talk I found out of him if at some schools you 
thank you Michael for being on the show I'm Michael was also kind enough to provide some notes that go along with the generator methods he was describing that we will include in the blog post that goes with this episode 
so go check that out go check out talk python training and now let's get back to the news I think of it it's your story yes it's my story I am so excited okay I love the story it connects most of my favorite things together our data science and sci fi feature ism futuristic myth I don't know whatever that word yeah it's awesome I have is that neither 
there's so many fascinating questions about the story that it that I kind of wish that was back in college like wasting hours my life waxing poetic about the meaning and value of our nd sitting on like college steps you know like late at night 
remind us is remember remember Jonathan 
well I do because that's exactly what I did in college that I was my I know not what dnmt I know I never had any of those days I was just stuck in some smelly underground dungeon of a lab doing Omar dnmt like 
none of this is just my leg dream fantasy of what college to be like them still totally jealous of your art schooling while I had to slap it with the rest of these rule followers to please my parents and maintain maintain my family honor yeah well I I found the meaning of life through self expression and collaboration so you know near 
yeah that's exactly what I'm doing 
it was it was like a scene in rent that actually this is this is no joke we went there was a bar where I went to school because it was in England and so you could put bars on campus because everybody was eighteen and and and I got some showing off even that's amazing so yeah even better that was that that wasn't the cabal you add the school where I went %HESITATION but because there were so many people who were in the musical theater I am not joking sometimes people would break out spontaneously into song and 
I thought it was because you know you watch a movie and you're like that would net why did they break out into song and dance this 
Dick illus just stop stop with this musical theater but there are places there are places where this occurs dnmt men if there was anything like that in my schooling I would I don't think it would be here I was probably still be there flatline old check that never laughed 
right just try to help out because you know yeah dnmt 
alright back in the story okay ready get get get get 
a computer 
just painted a brand new Rembrandt 
with such perfection that if Rembrandt came back to life and took a look he wouldn't be able to tell the difference 
in his pain 
computers 
well what we would do what did the way hold on hold except except because Rembrandt that no it hadn't painted it right member will be looking at it with a quick yeah I didn't do that like bright you would think if it is you know pains right right yeah okay it's a new painting yeah it's called the next Rembrandt and it's a new painting of a new subject it took eighteen months and a team of art historians data scientists and software developers to train a machine that studied three hundred at Rembrandt paintings 
and collected loads of data from them and develop algorithms that would be able to draw each of the elements that were common themes in Rembrandt's work 
so the final painting is a portrait of an imagined man imagined by the computer I guess Donald exact 
yeah it does look ads and I are like 
you know and and it was I guess painted slash printed by a three D. printer so you actually layered heats just the way that Rembrandt what Blair paint it had over thirty layers of paint based ink that match the layers of paint that gave his work death in perspective 
while my mind easily blown right now I am not once I know 
that's amazing amazing it's amazing how little actual three D. paint I mean three D. is somewhere in this context but it is like eat it like tactile right like yeah yeah it's like a real it's it's it's a real painting and it was a poor it's a portrait of a seventeenth century man and it is actually really beautiful I don't know if you're familiar with the way that 
works with light in his paintings that this computer nailed it 
like 
superdelegate so 
like who 
I guess now we can exist forever have amazing paintings from great artists 
and I could never really be bummed out if way away that's not that's not where I was going to decline that the big one dnmt was and nobody will ever be said 
it's almost Unna are lightweight going into this debate that I can't really 
defense behind nt 
%HESITATION but yeah this this brings up tons of questions that I think we should discuss care we should be the drinking absinthe of smoking handle cigarettes while we talk in French anxious for this story because that's kind of how I feel that you know 
olives are art school would be like 
I was like that we all talk in French accents 
you had to drink absinthe like tons of it we didn't drink absinthe because beer is pretty plentiful in England but we did handle cigarettes that was totally true wow anatomies old man it was cool I mean it felt cool at the beginning and after awhile you kind of like this actually feels gross and dirty 
also also PSA I am no longer a smoker I didn kids don't smoke exit hundred incidences where Zack and Kelly turn to the camera like but seriously 
spoilers 
one if you aren't old enough to have seen say back on the nineties there's another suggesting things to many drugs freaks out and they have to do a PSA afterwards that's the thing to which I'm referring and that's what I'm doing now don't smoke 
okay Rembrandt nnhs market attend that we have we have absent with beer and then like used his regular American 
it's a hard question 
so while I'm here you think who gets to claim to be the artist of this new painting 
computer 
the programmers and the historians and the data scientists that built the software or would you consider Rembrandt still really be the artist because it is it does come from 
technique it's not like it 
I know it's like the computer made up that 
mt 
on I know this is this is kind of a this is a profound question I think like I do maybe maybe surprisingly profound 
no it's not profound the computer programmer Gennaro didn't at all 
if you've made the software that makes the painting then won the computer doesn't get it because the computers get anything that's how computers work I guess songs I made the damn thing 
and then there's the artists 
well no because like your it's inspired by Rembrandt but it's not a 
Rembrandt like I could be a tell inspired by rem focuses on it it's just you 
it's like 
following okay thought about it this way 
they go out of his way it's like the 
programmers basically made very advanced 
he 
and the team prices are like basically looking at analyzing Rembrandt's workmanlike 
taking his absence of his work and eating 
though there's any absence of anybody in this it's gotta remember 
really funny kind of like saying it is an economic saying like so so Rembrandt didn't exist in a vacuum right like he was inspired by all of the other painters of his era 
and then other people were inspired by Rembrandt and they meet work that is similar in style to his and then you know forces he became popular that that that continued 
and so I mean is he really 
take it should he be credited for their work like people who were inspired by his style I mean I couldn't we could we really say that that the computer was a student of Rembrandt and now as well its own words nnat design at the computer maybe I mean because and I'd like to tell tell that 
with and 
I don't give away any spoilers here but I don't know if you've seen X. Makina I think it's a I think it's a poor choice not to give computers credit where credit is due another going to take I think because the venture that strategy is going to come back 
right maybe maybe to not turn out very well for the human so I'm not I don't get any more details but I think that if if we can get in the habit of giving computers credit for things and making them feel good about it I think it will be better for our relation we wouldn't be going anywhere I three 
so I don't fear where do you think nnhs 
I for one welcome our Rembrandt painting overlords 
nnova question number two eyes you retrain computers to remake are from all the greatest artists in the world then we can all have Picassos like forever and we can have like new unique ones and maybe they won't be worth as much as like the riyal Picasso's but who cares rate like you have one that no one ever 
no one else has and I mean people make fake diamonds out of their dead relatives and wear them and how is that even related 
well I think people they will be a market for peace for this type of art where they're like you know it's not really 
but it's it's it's it's a fake diamond it's not even a real I mean it is a real diamond anyway that's a whole different 
I think we've got this weird lands in the how you 
or fiance accusing wedding ring 
got dnmt no no the the white what I'm trying to get at is like people don't mind fake things 
but it's not I think it's a real 
inspired by Rembrandt painting that has nothing to do with interpret it sought of Rembrandt paintings instead odors painting I've totally I would love love to like 
I don't know find a style of painting that I would like that maybe possibly associated with particular painter give a photo wouldn't send them a photo and then I get back this awesome three D. painting of like you know me looking like you know one of those like very general Alexander photo 
one 
meaning of that wasn't part of any of this speak out I don't like the computer decide when the computer chooses 
what to paint based off of that are no that's less I'm like I don't wanna random I don't mean to be painting out there nd one obtaining of me I was the whole reason for Hardenbergh idolized as a god nonna that we're going to walk into your entryway in your house with a 
behind 
and if you like this massive photo if you looking into the death 
but when you're in the album household it's dear leader away by Wrenn but whatever 
but I went back in time dnmt 
I mean okay that's fine against each of them we I don't know that I would do that I think you'd be cool to dissolve the them computers like the side and they can give me things because then we would have to see the exact same like damn Bango starry night in every dorm room coffee shop thing 
and each person can have there and you know very own unique banged out I'm totally down Sonya 
yeah I am a little bit worried about all the people who currently produce coffee shop art though I mean where is that going to go that is the losing party in this one 
halfway through the great thing we didn off-again they have to compete with like the greats 
this is the end of the artistic classes that are doing singing in pubs in England right now because we're replacing you with robots and computers and yeah yeah I hate it candidate out the stuff if you don't have the chance to be one of the artist 
in a generation 
three than frankly you can kiss my **** because we have an algorithm nnat yeah I thought it was an awesome project was the brainchild of of of course an ad agency J. Walter Thompson for I. Angie thank you can watch a really cool short video on this project on next Rembrandt dot com 
people are doing all sorts of amazing things with deep learning and neural networks to develop algorithms that that make artistic images of hypersexual quality which basically means machines are being trained to produce images that could be called a fine art like 
completely original ones 
this isn't this is a different acknowledge it's not the same as training the computers on existing 
%HESITATION it's coming it's got its cool I want them to I want somebody to train a computer to work in the style of Damien Hirst 
I mean I hope in that it left side art school coming back but in the so in the nineties he was the guy that was like cutting apart cows 
and I could cut a cow and half me put each half in like an aquarium tank of formaldehyde and then you could walk in the middle of it and it would be in like fancy modern this is exactly how the robot apocalypse happens it's not some fire is made by the military because some art students like you know what I'm doing with a program this thing to follow that style and then all of a sudden it's like look at all these things I can split apart a turn and artistic dnmt murdering people nnu like robot why are you doing it like for my heart you fish in the set about it 
all those great doesn't know I am loved this story to get one 
alright my story is is cooler but not not as happy as her story I feel like yours has a lot of lightning spot between doesn't okay 
so this story come from Eric Bernhardt's them which I'm not sure if I'm saying that right will discover that Eric burdensome 
I he is a data scientist at better and in New York and as I'm sure all the new Yorkers are listening to this no atom all new Yorkers are accessed with the MTA which is the city subway line just exactly at I think everything about Italy like there's you know like they know every single proudly noble the times it's like 
a badge of honor that they don't like the in 
existem 
okay 
so because New York is a is an awesome city and at because it sort of has this part of the open government the idea of open data and releasing data and actually has an API which is just sort of a pipeline of data that you can plug into which gives you the current arrival times 
of all the subway train sets of departure times an arrival times 
so what area did is he actually I connected to this API and just started downloading current arrival time through the subway trains 
and then he kind of forgot about it like he's doing whatever I can always includes something else you forgot about rock incomes that months later and he actually has four gigabytes of data on on subway arrival times from a bunch of different train lines in New York which is cool in itself right because I know that a lot of listeners to this podcast right now are thinking colic magical the cool stuff I could do with that record like plot arrival times like it like you know figure out delays neck and stuff 
and it is like a bit of that is you know in in this blog post but I see his main question is much more specific and very familiar to anyone who is commuted daily to work 
%HESITATION using public transportation 
okay so imagine this ogre it's out of work there is a thing they froze like I've I told over the net like I heard that like I just heard a talk by %HESITATION this guy called John Akers who works for a company called Silicon Valley to science and they did the same thing but they were literally doing just that by predicting delays and arrival times 
using like I don't like sound waves of trains or something nnhs and it OP terroristic it is it is that he's actually gonna talk I was at the event when he was talking in his go hit like he's going to give a little overview of it on the show which we call gravity or doing it later but like but what else what else would you want to know ID say this is that this is the nice little point okay after work you're tired you're hungry and you just wanna go home at night Watson ethics 
so you walk over to the train platform and no trains arrived yet and the sign that you know that's displaying this the train status is like doesn't really display your trainer thing like that so you're waiting and you're waiting and you're waiting and then this is point that everyone has thought about where you're like you know what 
you used to ski cap like that is always a thought to go through I haven't like I do well yeah and my current visual nnst train station black and figure out another way of getting home or should I continue to wait because I pleaded so long that like it must be right around them like you right on the corner that everyone has as I thought every single time and you can like start walking towards the exit like I am going to I'm gonna make check and see if 
but like 
our nnat I I need somebody leaves and it just looking 
that the anxiety by a factor of yeah well he's actually on the urine all 
you're all in on it together like suddenly you and in the other passengers on that dnmt note that what do they know that you don't write down things like checking their phones I go maybe maybe the app tells the time the train to the southward doesn't maybe maybe apps yeah we've all lived there they have insider knowledge 
so I never lived in New York but I've commuted by train you know in DC in Miami and they were just got them a lot a lot a lot of drinking 
okay 
and I can tell you that like this is probably the most frustrating feeling of ever ever had like you just you don't know what to do right you've invested so much time on this platform like do you abandon it do you just like you waiting which unseeded 
and this is the question that he was trying to ask 
so what Eric was going for was to try to figure out two questions based on this data 
how much longer should you expect to wait 
given that you've been waiting for a certain amount of time 
and at what point should you just give up and figure out another wave going home 
and he has to interesting findings from this 
and this first one 
this personal stuff okay 
so 
the longer you end up waiting for a train 
according to his data the longer you will have to continue to wait 
which is weird also I'm going I will unpack this for a second existential crisis I know it does me like that I feel like I'm watching a play right now mn early waiting for Godot man this is the most pretentious apne apne into Damien Hirst 
Sam back at home I think that the same line but whatever it's pretentious we should be ashamed of ourselves 
okay I hate nbae I will magazine and you're the one with the PhD up the three of us that should be pretentious it should be you know like I was throwing away some people think I'm cool you guys of the one after that washing it out there everyone hates you yeah that's because we're insecure that's what it is nnj 
through my measly undergrad nt invent ways this 
smart well I think we can we've got up to the I I started with a good point and I we got up okay here we go alright but I think that after the Exxon longer you've waited for 
the longer you will have to wait saving up 
according to Eric's data 
if you have waited probably say fifteen minutes for a train and it still hasn't come 
you will probably end up having to wait another eight minutes for the 
so you've waited fifteen you probably have to wait eight more 
however 
if after those eight minutes the train still hasn't arrived see waited fifteen minutes and then eight minutes 
you actually have to wait for another twelve minutes 
which is our soul crushing five because that means that like the longer you're waiting it's like how this is like the delay must take for ever in our eggs after you've been waiting for fifteen minutes you gotta keep on going like it's just going to take it it means that if you waited for an and an unusually long period of time you're going to have to continue to pay for more unusually long period time which is sad which is a very sad idea and probably really soul crushing if you're like sitting on the platform being like out there dammit 
what is that what is the cut off like after me I tend to feel after like thirty seconds that we did an unusually hot manner like you ever get on the train you 
so I think he does some some basic math and I see figures out a 
part of the equation that you would need to figure out whether or not you should 
it quit 
so okay 
say you don't want to weigh more than thirty minutes for a train 
okay 
that means according to according to his data 
after eleven minutes 
you should just give up and take attack at cab 
tag notch or something dnmt give up and tag the subway Chris was here in my black braid pain and its stock and I left 
don't wait for Godot you pretentious on 
alright because if you don't have eleven minutes or if you don't leave for thirty minutes they got me all messed up as number the rear 
I think if you about thirty minutes eleven minutes you're like you're like that guy in a beautiful mind 
right now you're like a reason that you can't wait for the train is because the spies tell you not only for twelve minutes a lot of jobs thirty minutes fifty seven 
a lot of men 
I think I like John judge Wapner is that kind of where we're going with this government our enemy 
I who's too many too many pop culture references that nobody's going to understand ha ha ha ha 
no don't match them up done that's amazing Nash equilibrium monitors and well yeah I know John asked him at the wedding that walking without without rain and it's probably a little bit son asked of course every notion alright wait so if you waited for thirteen or you only one way for thirty minutes and he waited for eleven minutes 
you should leave because the time that they 
you have to wait longer than the remaining minutes 
before the train wreck that's his that's his argument based on his data 
which there's parts that that he sort of left out we'll you know like anyone is our thinking about this 
has following missiles following this in their head would realize you have to think about the time it takes you to actually get a cab or get a new pair in the time it takes to get home and all the other parts of your commute these just taking like one part of that equation but it's an interesting idea that you know what like you should actually say okay all the time that I've been waiting up to now is sunk costs and I should not think that because I've waited for twelve minutes I'm set it's like nope you were waiting for twelve minutes 
you should decide unspoken what you're going to do it I don't wait another twelve minutes 
decide if it's worth while the you to ditch it 
because it turns out that you might hinting up waiting on the platform for a long long time 
and we will link to Eric's blog post which actually has that the curve and everything like he's he's my little outside like you see the curve for every single time and see the car for you 
so the cut off care for different different train lines %HESITATION it's cool it's super awesome it's a little bit Matthey his lot of like you know questions in there but that's not that's not too bad am I suggest you take it out because it it you know if you end up waiting on a train platform I think you have time to sit and read through dnmt like us before you decide to get into her which is 
well you know what I wonder do you know this is just if you are one person and you're doing this like just yourself because I think that if you're with any other person then a lot of time will be wasted in the whole dynamics will be thrown off is when you go Chicago area she way and then you like starts the whole conversation they're like oh yeah let's just let's just wait a little bit many of two people who have like different threshold of what two long 
so your point is a psychology component to this 
yeah I could see that I think you know to be the person is like asking over and over again like Hey Hey so we go 
sugar yeah her husband after 
it seems to say I really wanna say once they like when do I time bastn 
yeah 
yeah it's at nine minutes to give everybody else two minutes the feel anxious about with an aficionado and intellect and right back in the 
get out 
Larry no immobile and I like it sneaks another were in on it does that ruin it like now as soon we went wherever in a group and you go Hey guys you think we should keep waiting for the train of like Ono I know what's happening like dnmt apparently vehicle if we're also delivery platform after thirty seconds but we like I was talking about as we're going going already literally were outside is waiting 
you you only by metro card so that you can like walk in and out of the trance dnmt 
I mean sometimes the train there and then you run and you get in your car sifts you'll have to Alkan's here you walk into the trades they said and you run for the trade or it's too late right you never guessed train right 
right I think I save more time in the overall that with that strategy 
it is it is except for those 
stations that are like where the platform is like down in the bowels of the train and the like I like a look there's an el stop in your like cool %HESITATION except Alsop was like beneath that Affan beneath the and you are anything and so you're like seven stories down and then you get there and there's like one other dude and it's like next train forty seven minutes and you're like I said I think 
actually I really doubt that al has those like by minute wait times I bet it just says like next train made 
sn depends 
boom okay 
I'm 
so we have an outline of this week our our segment that's at least a two standard deviations away from the main 
zinc 
yeah I you know what you know actually that's not really the best way to to find out liars dnmt really good job and then they actually does just you know just you know yes this other ways 
there's behind him I mean I thought 
sorry about shorthand but it's not 
so if you are for the job was Martha hits it's worth it because the other one is actually because like you quantiles and I'd this too much there be different too much out of money the IQ are 
HitFix nnat well and IQ are like that a person who's like well the reason the joke is funny if you understand 
you know linear algebra 
but it doesn't get 
it's her whole all of that aside 
this week we hear from Adam Smith one of the founders of kite I'm a relatively new AI powered pair programming at the just for python developers so heads up we actually recorded this just before kite was released arm and then I didn't have time to put into the show because we didn't record a show for awhile %HESITATION so it's already out so if you're talking about when it comes out it's going to be so great I'm just know that that's already happened and you can 
I think you've got a kite that comic I thought I or whatever it is willing to it on the website on and check it out Spiegel 
Hey I don't think we're going on the show 
yeah thanks for having me Natalie so can 
give us give us the lowdown what's going on with Kate 
yes so we're launching a new product that day %HESITATION the real excited about has been working on for awhile %HESITATION you know at the front not the most fundamental shift that were making his canteen programming environments to to the cloud and in real time 
%HESITATION so essentially we felt that stops after that watches as you're writing code %HESITATION regardless of editor and will plug you into information and and a community %HESITATION senator round whatever doing at the moment 
so if you're %HESITATION you know using an API will show you documentation will show you how I caught examples %HESITATION we can also detect %HESITATION certain errors in your code as soon as you make them and suggest fixes and %HESITATION yeah so it's kind of this co pilot %HESITATION %HESITATION for programmers or as we also like to call it like an artificial pair programming 
it's kind of amazing so like as I'm as I'm going through %HESITATION you know I'm writing a program and I I like I sat finger something %HESITATION and I've you know called the wrong method or you know of call the method on and %HESITATION a class that actually doesn't exist 
but that is that the that the sort of thing that you guys would catch in the what happens when you when you notice it is it just like a normal IDE with a little like you know redline of mistake undertaxed or or what what happens 
yeah so this is we detect a mistake like that will actually %HESITATION give you %HESITATION and show you a sex socio disappear with like this is the change we suggest you make and then we just give you one click a button to 
by that fixed your code 
and and then how do you guys actually know all that about the packages that I am consuming like how how is it that you have that in for 
and right there at my fingertips that's pretty amazing 
yeah so what was done on our back and is built a a map of everything in the python world %HESITATION so is basically is imported %HESITATION thousands of packages off of pipeline on the back and %HESITATION %HESITATION and still pull them into docker containers and then walks the %HESITATION entire namespace and entire hierarchy to introspective %HESITATION every object %HESITATION inside that package and then we cross reference out against all the code on get hub so that we know about the popularity of route at a different %HESITATION API's 
so if you make a %HESITATION typo %HESITATION you know if there may be two different possible things you intended to type but more often than not one will be you know a hundred times more popular than the other and so we can make a pretty strong protection about %HESITATION what you're looking for %HESITATION whether it's you know you made a typo or even just %HESITATION with a really smooth completions experience as you're writing code 
that's 
already kind of awesome it's like all of the best things that I would want out of an ID E. without though like horrible heavyweight disaster of actually trying to use a full featured had he 
yeah so and what's what's next minutes on the possibilities for this kind of thing this is just your first release right 
yeah so this is the first version and %HESITATION we're just getting started so you know we've been working on this for a year and a half now and a lot of the time it's been spent building Canada infrastructural layers of integrating with different editors and having %HESITATION the kite up %HESITATION and doing this kind of code introspection and all these other things and so you know we're really excited to add to get this out there %HESITATION and you know we're excited to enter it on on the feature set from fit based on feedback and we're also excited to get %HESITATION people plugged into the community so there are parts of the product where %HESITATION you can leave notes for other Kate users %HESITATION different API's %HESITATION and you know we're excited to %HESITATION kind of scale up the the future of programming from here 
and I'm sure that a lot of our listeners are python programmers because you know python is the best language in the universe 
so how could people how can the how can people get involved 
yeah so I just go to Kate dot com KITV dot com and %HESITATION you can check out a demo video %HESITATION that will be launched on the homepage today and %HESITATION ticket you can sign up with their email address and %HESITATION will be %HESITATION sending out you know invites %HESITATION over the coming weeks 
well that's awesome well thanks man for being on the show and thanks for giving anybody a heads up about it I'm sure will lot will sense of people your way and I'm excited to try it out myself 
that sounds great listen to an invite thanks Jonathan alright things out of 
nnat all rights 
thanks Adam for the heads up about kites 
and that is all we have 
huge thanks to Michael first programming tips 
%HESITATION enforced cute things the cloud factory go check them out cloud factory dot com slash partially it's ten percent do the name a who back next week in the meantime you can follow us at partially de you can follow bid at bed underscore spend the night Chris at Chris Alvin and of course you can follow me at John at the Morgan 
you can keep tabs on properly our analytics platform for software developers an all around amazing good looking people act toppling dot com thanks everybody have a great week
